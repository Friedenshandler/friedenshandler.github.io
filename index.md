## Introduction

Hi, I'm Felix! I am currently a 3rd-year student at Swarthmore College, studying history (major) and anthropology (minor). When I'm not busy reading, I like to cook, hike in the scenic Pennsylvania countryside, and play video games.

## Research interests

As part of the [Summer Research and Opportunities](https://www.swarthmore.edu/summer-research-opportunities) program at Swarthmore, I am currently
studying **combined arms warfare** under the generalship of Gustavus Adolphus. One of the specific research aims is the influence of Adolphus's use of artillery on future armies, and how Adolphus's military operations shaped the Napoleonic Wars two centuries later.
